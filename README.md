# Tamagotchi + The Sims

**Live Demo**: [tamagotchi-fpaq.vercel.app](https://tamagotchi-fpaq.vercel.app/)

## About the Project

This project was created as part of **Three.js Journey Challenge #16** and marks my first participation in the challenge. The original scope was adjusted to meet the deadline, but the core mechanics are in place.

## How to Play

- **Enter the World**: Double-click the screen to enter the Tamagotchi world.
- **Objective**: Keep the pet alive by managing its needs.
- **Interactions**:
  - Interact with objects in the room to fulfill the pet's needs.
  - If the **Happiness** stat reaches zero, the pet will die, and the game will be over.

## To-Do List

- [ ] Implement death mechanic
- [x] Style the UI
